Rancher 致力于向社区披露我们产品的安全问题。我们会针对已解决的问题发布安全公告和 CVE（Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures，通用漏洞披露）。Rancher GitHub 上的[安全页面](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories)也会发布新的安全公告。

| ID | 描述 | 日期 | 解决 |
|----|-------------|------|------------|
| [CVE-2024-58260](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-q82v-h4rq-5c86) | Setting the username of one user as the same username of another user causes an error when either user attempts to log in. Therefore, a user with the `Manage Users` permission could potentially deny any user, including admins, from logging in. To prevent this, usernames have been made immutable once set, and it is not possible to update or create a user with a username that is already in use. | 25 Sep 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.2), [v2.11.6](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.6), [v2.10.10](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.10), and [v2.9.12](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.12) |
| [CVE-2024-58267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-v3vj-5868-2ch2) | The Rancher CLI is modified to print the `requestId` more visibly than as part of the login URL. It also adds a `cli=true` origin marker to the URL. The dashboard is modified to recognize the presence of the `requestId` and uses that to show a warning message to the user, asking for verification that they initiated a CLI login with the related Id. The non-presence of the origin marker enables the dashboard to distinguish between the modified CLI and older CLI’s, and adjust the message accordingly. | 25 Sep 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.2), [v2.11.6](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.6), [v2.10.10](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.10), and [v2.9.12](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.12) |
| [CVE-2025-54468](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-mjcp-rj3c-36fr) | `Impersonate-*` headers are removed for requests made through the `/meta/proxy` Rancher endpoint (e.g. when cloud credentials are being created) as the headers may contain identifiable and/or sensitive information. | 25 Sep 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.2), [v2.11.6](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.6), [v2.10.10](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.10), and [v2.9.12](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.12) |
| [CVE-2024-58259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-4h45-jpvh-6p5j) | POSTs to the Rancher API endpoints are now limited to 1 Mi; this is configurable through the settings if you need a larger limit. The Rancher authentication endpoints are configured independently of the main public API (as you might need bigger payloads in the other API endpoints). Suppose you need to increase the maximum allowed payload for authentication. In that case, you can set the environment variable `CATTLE_AUTH_API_BODY_LIMIT` to a quantity, e.g., 2 Mi, which would allow larger payloads for the authentication endpoints. | 28 Aug 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.1), [v2.11.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.5), [v2.10.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.9) and [v2.9.11](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.11) |
| [CVE-2024-52284](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-6h9x-9j5v-7w9h) | Following a recent [change](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/3403) excluding Helm values files from bundles, an edge case subsisted where the values files referenced in `fleet.yaml` with your directory name (e.g., `my-dir/values.yaml` instead of `values.yaml`) would not be excluded, which would potentially expose confidential data in bundle resources. Helm values files are now excluded from bundle resources regardless of how you reference them. | 28 Aug 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.1), [v2.11.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.5) and [v2.10.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.9) |
| [CVE-2025-23390](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-xgpc-q899-67p8) | This vulnerability only affects customers using [Continuous Delivery with Fleet](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/integrations-in-rancher/fleet) where Fleet does not validate a server's certificate when connecting through SSH. This can allow for a main-in-the-middle-attack against Fleet. The fix provides a new `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` value for the `fleet` Helm chart. The default value is set to **`true` (opt-in) for Rancher v2.9 - v2.11** for backward compatibility. The default value is set to **`false` (opt-out) for Rancher v2.12 and later**, and Fleet v0.13 and later. <br/><br/> `true` (opt-in): <br/><br/><ul> If `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` is set to `true`, then not finding any matching `known_hosts` entry for an SSH host will not lead to any error. Please note, regardless of the configuration setting, if the `known-hosts` ConfigMap is deleted it will lead to errors as it will be considered a symptom of an incomplete Fleet deployment. </ul> `false` (opt-out): <br/><br/><ul> If `insecureSkipHostKeyChecks` is set to `false`, then strict host key checks are enabled. When enabled, the checks ensure that when using SSH, Fleet rejects connection attempts to hosts not matching any entry found in (decreasing order of precedence): <br/><br/><ul> <li>A secret referenced by name in a `GitRepo` which is located in the same `GitRepo's` namespace.</li> <li> If no such secret name is provided, in a `gitcredential` secret located in the same namespace. </li> <li> A new `known-hosts` ConfigMap, created during the Fleet chart installation time and located in the namespace `cattle-fleet-system`. </li></ul> <br></br> This happens regardless of whether a `GitRepo` uses an SSH URL to point to a Git repository since, once cloned, a repository may be found to contain external resources to be retrieved, such as Helm artifacts. </ul> A limitation with the default `known_hosts` entries is that they are only provided for GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket and Azure DevOps hosts. If you need to connect to a different host, or if key fingerprints for the provided entries are updated, the following options are available: <br/><br/><ul><li> Manually update the default `known-hosts` ConfigMap. </li>  <li> Reference a secret from your `GitRepo` resources, containing the updated or additional `known_hosts` entries. </li> <li> Create a `gitcredential` secret containing the entries for `GitRepo` resources that do not already reference a secret. </li></ul> | 24 Apr 2025 | Rancher [v2.11.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.1), [v2.10.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.5), and [v2.9.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.9) |
| [CVE-2024-22031](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8h6m-wv39-239m) | A vulnerability was found where users could create a project and then gain access to arbitrary projects. As a fix, a new field has been added to projects called the `BackingNampespace`, which represents the namespace created for a project containing all resources needed for project operations. This includes resources such as ProjectRoleTemplateBindings, project-scoped secrets and workloads. <br/><br/> The field is populated automatically during project creation and is formatted as `<clusterID>-<project.Name>`. For example, if your project is named `project-abc123` in a cluster with ID `cluster-xyz789`, then the project will have the `BackingNampespace`: `cluster-xyz789-project-abc123`. <br/><br/> If the `BackingNampespace` field is empty then the project will fallback to using the namespace that is the project's name as it did before. Existing projects will not be migrated and only newly created projects will have the new namespace naming convention. If listing projects via `kubectl` the `BackingNampespace` will also be listed as a column. | 24 Apr 2025 | Rancher [v2.11.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.1), [v2.10.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.5), and [v2.9.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.9) |
| [CVE-2023-32198](https://github.com/rancher/steve/security/advisories/GHSA-95fc-g4gj-mqmx) | A vulnerability was found where users with permission to create a service in the Kubernetes cluster where Rancher is deployed can take over the Rancher UI, display their own UI, and gather sensitive information. This is only possible when the setting `ui-offline-preferred` is set to `remote`. This release introduces a patch, and the malicious user can no longer serve their own UI. If users can't upgrade, please make sure that only trustable users have access to create a service in the local cluster. | 24 Apr 2025 | Rancher [v2.11.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.1), [v2.10.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.5), [v2.9.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.9) and [v2.8.15](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.8.15) |
| [CVE-2025-23391](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-8p83-cpfg-fj3g) | A vulnerability has been identified within Rancher where a Restricted Administrator can change the password of Administrators and take over their accounts. A Restricted Administrator should not be allowed to change the password of more privileged users unless it contains the Manage Users permissions. A new validation has been added to block a user from editing or deleting another user with more permissions than themselves. Rancher deployments where the Restricted Administrator role is not being used are not affected by this CVE. | 31 Mar 2025 | Rancher [v2.11.0](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.0), [v2.10.4](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.4), [v2.9.8](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.8) and [v2.8.14](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.8.14) |
