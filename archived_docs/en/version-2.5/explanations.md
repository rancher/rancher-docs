title: Explanations
---

**Explanatory docs** are concerned primarily with providing theoretical knowledge for the "why" behind a task or a topic. Explanations are "understanding-oriented" in nature and will clarify a topic in order to broaden the user's knowledge. In this section, users can find additional context and background, alternatives or even opinions on topics, and often historical reasons, constraints, and insights into why a process works the way that it does.
