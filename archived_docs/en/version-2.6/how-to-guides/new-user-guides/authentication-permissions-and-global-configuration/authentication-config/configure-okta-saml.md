If your organization uses Okta Identity Provider (IdP) for user authentication, you can configure Rancher to allow your users to log in using their IdP credentials.

:::note

Okta integration only supports Service Provider initiated logins.

:::
## Prerequisites

In Okta, create a SAML Application with the settings below. See the [Okta documentation](https://developer.okta.com/standards/SAML/setting_up_a_saml_application_in_okta) for help.

Setting | Value
------------|------------
`Single Sign on URL` | `https://yourRancherHostURL/v1-saml/okta/saml/acs`
`Audience URI (SP Entity ID)` | `https://yourRancherHostURL/v1-saml/okta/saml/metadata`

## Configuring Okta in Rancher

1.	In the top left corner, click **â˜° > Users & Authentication**.
1. In the left navigation menu, click **Auth Provider**.
1. Click **Okta**.
1.	Complete the **Configure Okta Account** form. The examples below describe how you can map Okta attributes from attribute statements to fields within Rancher.

    | Field                     | Description                                                                   |
    | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Display Name Field        | The attribute name from an attribute statement that contains the display name of users.                        |
    | User Name Field           | The attribute name from an attribute statement that contains the user name/given name.                         |
    | UID Field                 | The attribute name from an attribute statement that is unique to every user.                                    |
    | Groups Field              | The attribute name in a group attribute statement that exposes your groups.        |
    | Rancher API Host          | The URL for your Rancher Server.                                              |
    | Private Key / Certificate | A key/certificate pair used for Assertion Encryption.                         |
    | Metadata XML              | The `Identity Provider metadata` file that you find in the application `Sign On` section.  |

    :::tip

    You can generate a key/certificate pair using an openssl command. For example:

    ```
    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myservice.key -out myservice.crt
    ```

    :::

1. After you complete the **Configure Okta Account** form, click **Enable**.

    Rancher redirects you to the IdP login page. Enter credentials that authenticate with Okta IdP to validate your Rancher Okta configuration.

    :::note

    If nothing seems to happen, it's likely because your browser blocked the pop-up. Make sure you disable the pop-up blocker for your rancher domain and whitelist it in any other extensions you might utilize.

    :::

**Result:** Rancher is configured to work with Okta. Your users can now sign into Rancher using their Okta logins.

:::note SAML Provider Caveats:

- SAML Protocol does not support search or lookup for users or groups. Therefore, there is no validation on users or groups when adding them to Rancher.
- When adding users, the exact user IDs (i.e. `UID Field`) must be entered correctly. As you type the user ID, there will be no search for other  user IDs that may match.
- When adding groups, you must select the group from the drop-down that is next to the text box. Rancher assumes that any input from the text box is a user.
- The group drop-down shows only the groups that you are a member of. You will not be able to add groups that you are not a member of.
