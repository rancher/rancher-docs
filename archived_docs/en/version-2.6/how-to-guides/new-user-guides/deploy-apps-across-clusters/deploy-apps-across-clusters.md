Rancher offers several ways to deploy applications across clusters, depending on version.

## Fleet

Rancher v2.5 introduced Fleet, a new way to deploy applications across clusters.

Continuous Delivery with Fleet is GitOps at scale. For more information, refer to the [Fleet section](fleet.md).

### Multi-cluster Apps

In Rancher before v2.5, the multi-cluster apps feature was used to deploy applications across clusters. The multi-cluster apps feature is deprecated, but still available as a legacy feature.

See the [multi-cluster app documentation](multi-cluster-apps.md) for more details.
