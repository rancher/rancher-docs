:::caution

Running on an ARM64 platform is currently an experimental feature and is not yet officially supported in Rancher. Therefore, we do not recommend using ARM64 based nodes in a production environment.

:::

The following options are available when using an ARM64 platform:

- Running Rancher on ARM64 based node(s)
  - Only for Docker Install. Please note that the following installation command replaces the examples found in the [Docker Install link](../../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/other-installation-methods/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker/rancher-on-a-single-node-with-docker.md):

  ```
  # In the last line `rancher/rancher:vX.Y.Z`, be certain to replace "X.Y.Z" with a released version in which ARM64 builds exist. For  example, if your matching version is v2.5.8, you would fill in this line with `rancher/rancher:v2.5.8`.
  docker run -d --restart=unless-stopped \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    --privileged \
    rancher/rancher:vX.Y.Z
  ```

:::note

To check if your specific released version is compatible with the ARM64 architecture, you may navigate to your
version's release notes in the following two ways:

- Manually find your version using https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases.
- Go directly to your version using the tag and the specific version number. If you plan to use v2.5.8, for example, you may navigate to https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.5.8.

:::

- Create custom cluster and adding ARM64 based node(s)
  - Kubernetes cluster version must be 1.12 or higher
  - CNI Network Provider must be [Flannel](../../../faq/container-network-interface-providers.md#flannel)
- Importing clusters that contain ARM64 based nodes
  - Kubernetes cluster version must be 1.12 or higher

Please see [Cluster Options](../../../reference-guides/cluster-configuration/rancher-server-configuration/rke1-cluster-configuration.md) how to configure the cluster options.

The following features are not tested:

- Monitoring, alerts, notifiers, pipelines and logging
- Launching apps from the catalog
