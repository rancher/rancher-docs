---

This page covers installing the Rancher Prime PAYG offering on Microsoft's Azure Marketplace.

## How to Install Rancher Prime PAYG

The following steps describe how to create a new deployment of Rancher Prime from the Azure Marketplace page.

1. Select the **Rancher Prime with 24x7 Support** offer (either **EU and UK only** or **non-EU and non-UK only**) that corresponds to the location where your account is registered.
1. Choose a plan from the dropdown menu. View the **Plans + Pricing** tab for more details about the plan.
1. Select **Create**.

### Basics

On the **Basics** tab, specify the **Project details** and **Instance details**:

1. Select an existing **Subscription** from the dropdown menu.
1. Select an existing **Resource group** from the dropdown menu.

   :::note

   The **Create new** resource group feature is not supported.

   :::

1. Select an existing **AKS Cluster Name** from the dropdown menu.
1. Choose an **Extension Resource name**. It can consist of alphanumeric characters and dots and must be between 2 and 253 characters long.
1. Select **Next**.

### Rancher Configuration

On the **Rancher Configuraion** tab, specify the following information:

![Rancher Configuration](/img/install-rancher-prime-bootstrap-password.png)

1. Enter the **Hostname** for Rancher. The Rancher hostname must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). The Rancher server URL will be created using this hostname.
   :::note

   The IP address of the Rancher hostname must be resolvable by a public DNS.

   :::
1. Using the slider, select the number of **Replicas**.
1. Choose and confirm a **Bootstrap Password**. During the first login, you will use the bootstrap password to authenticate to the Rancher dashboard.
   :::note

   The current Rancher deployment exposes the bootstrap password in the Cluster configuration settings in the Azure Portal. Until this security issue is resolved, we suggest changing the Admin password after initial login, by editing your profile in the Rancher dashboard.

   :::
1. Select **Next**.

### Review + create

1. On the **Review + create** tab, review the summary of the offer (Price, Basics, Rancher Configuration) and the link to **view automation template** (Azure Resource Manager Template).
1. Select **Create** to start the deployment.

### Deployment Complete

When the deployment successfully completes, Rancher Prime will be installed.

:::note

On the **Extensions + applications** page, the **Provisioning State** may show **Succeeded** even though the deployment may still be in progress. You can monitor the deployment progress by logging into the AKS cluster and looking at the **rancher-cloud** deployment.

:::

## Log into the Rancher Dashboard

You may now log in to the Rancher dashboard by pointing your browser to the Rancher server URL `https://<host-name>`. The `<host-name>` is the hostname you entered when you [configured Rancher](#rancher-configuration).

:::note

The Rancher hostname must be resolvable by public DNS. See the [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md) for more details.

## How to Use Rancher

After you login to Rancher Prime, you should notice the **Welcome to Rancher Prime** message at the top of the screen.

If your Rancher Prime PAYG deployment only has **Welcome to Rancher** at the top of the screen, make sure that you've updated to the latest version, and reset the branding to default (i.e., "suse") from **Global Settings**.

## Rancher Prime PAYG Billing

View billing information in the Azure Portal by going to **Home** > **Cost Management (subscription) | Cost analysis**.

## Uninstalling Rancher Prime PAYG Offering

Uninstalling Rancher Prime may not remove all of the Kubernetes resources created by Rancher. Run the [Rancher resource cleanup script](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-cleanup) to perform a more comprehensive cleanup.

The best practice for uninstalling the Rancher Prime PAYG offering is to migrate any non-Rancher workloads to a different cluster and destroy the Rancher cluster.

:::warning
Ensure that you prepare and migrate any non-Rancher workloads off of the cluster before you destroy the cluster. These resources are nonrecoverable.
