Use one of the following guides to deploy and provision Rancher and a Kubernetes cluster in the provider of your choice.

- [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.md) (uses Terraform)
- [AWS](aws.md) (uses Terraform)
- [Azure](azure.md) (uses Terraform)
- [GCP](gcp.md) (uses Terraform)
- [Vagrant](vagrant.md)

If you prefer, the following guide will take you through the same process in individual steps. Use this if you want to run Rancher in a different provider, on prem, or if you would just like to see how easy it is.

- [Manual Install](helm-cli.md)
