For information on the different ways that Rancher can be installed, refer to the [overview of installation options.](../../getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade.md#overview-of-installation-options)

For a list of main features of the Rancher API server, refer to the [overview section.](../../getting-started/introduction/overview.md#features-of-the-rancher-api-server)

For guidance about setting up the underlying infrastructure for the Rancher server, refer to the [architecture recommendations.](architecture-recommendations.md)
