Rancher provides a set of alerts for cluster scans. which are not configured to have notifiers by default:

- A manual cluster scan was completed
- A manual cluster scan has failures
- A scheduled cluster scan was completed
- A scheduled cluster scan has failures

:::note Prerequisite

You need to configure a [notifier](../../../explanations/integrations-in-rancher/notifiers.md) before configuring, sending, or receiving alerts.
