If you want to provide a user with access and permissions to _all_ projects, nodes, and resources within a cluster, assign the user a cluster membership.

>**Tip:** Want to provide a user with access to a _specific_ project within a cluster? See [Adding Project Members](../../manage-projects/add-users-to-projects.md) instead.

There are two contexts where you can add cluster members:

- Adding Members to a New Cluster

    You can add members to a cluster as you create it (recommended if possible).

- [Adding Members to an Existing Cluster](#editing-cluster-membership)

    You can always add members to a cluster after a cluster is provisioned.

## Editing Cluster Membership

Cluster administrators can edit the membership for a cluster, controlling which Rancher users can access the cluster and what features they can use.

1. From the **Global** view, open the cluster that you want to add members to.

2. From the main menu, select **Members**. Then click **Add Member**.

3. Search for the user or group that you want to add to the cluster.

    If external authentication is configured:

    - Rancher returns users from your [external authentication](../../../../pages-for-subheaders/about-authentication.md) source as you type.

        >**Using AD but can't find your users?**
        >There may be an issue with your search attribute configuration. See [Configuring Active Directory Authentication: Step 5](../../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/about-authentication/authentication-config/configure-active-directory.md).

    - A drop-down allows you to add groups instead of individual users. The drop-down only lists groups that you, the logged in user, are part of.

        >**Note:** If you are logged in as a local user, external users do not display in your search results. For more information, see [External Authentication Configuration and Principal Users](../../../../pages-for-subheaders/about-authentication.md#external-authentication-configuration-and-principal-users).

4. Assign the user or group **Cluster** roles.

    [What are Cluster Roles?](../../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles.md)

    >**Tip:** For Custom Roles, you can modify the list of individual roles available for assignment.
    >
    > - To add roles to the list, [Add a Custom Role](../../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/custom-roles.md).
    > - To remove roles from the list, [Lock/Unlock Roles](../../authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/locked-roles.md).

**Result:** The chosen users are added to the cluster.

- To revoke cluster membership, select the user and click **Delete**. This action deletes membership, not the user.
- To modify a user's roles in the cluster, delete them from the cluster, and then re-add them with modified roles.
