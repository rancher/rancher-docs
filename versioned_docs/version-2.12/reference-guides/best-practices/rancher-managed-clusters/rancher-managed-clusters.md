### Logging

Refer to [this guide](logging-best-practices.md) for our recommendations for cluster-level logging and application logging.

### Monitoring

Configuring sensible monitoring and alerting rules is vital for running any production workloads securely and reliably. Refer to this [guide](monitoring-best-practices.md) for our recommendations.

### Disconnected clusters

Rancher supports managing clusters that may not always be online due to network disruptions, control plane availability, or because all cluster nodes are down. Refer to this [guide](disconnected-clusters.md) for our recommendations.

### Tips for Setting Up Containers

Running well-built containers can greatly impact the overall performance and security of your environment. Refer to this [guide](tips-to-set-up-containers.md) for tips.

### Best Practices for Rancher Managed VMware vSphere Clusters

This [guide](rancher-managed-clusters-in-vsphere.md) outlines a reference architecture for provisioning downstream Rancher clusters in a vSphere environment, in addition to standard vSphere best practices as documented by VMware.
