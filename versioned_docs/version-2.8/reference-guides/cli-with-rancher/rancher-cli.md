The Rancher CLI (Command Line Interface) is a unified tool that you can use to interact with Rancher. With this tool, you can operate Rancher using a command line rather than the GUI.

## Download Rancher CLI

The binary can be downloaded directly from the UI.

1. In the upper left corner, click **â˜°**.
1. At the bottom of the navigation sidebar menu, click **About**.
1. Under the **CLI Downloads section**, there are links to download the binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can also check the [releases page for our CLI](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases) for direct downloads of the binary.

## Requirements

After you download the Rancher CLI, you need to make a few configurations. Rancher CLI requires:

- Your Rancher Server URL, which is used to connect to Rancher Server.
- An API Bearer Token, which is used to authenticate with Rancher. For more information about obtaining a Bearer Token, see [Creating an API Key](../user-settings/api-keys.md).

## CLI Authentication

Before you can use Rancher CLI to control your Rancher Server, you must authenticate using an API Bearer Token. Log in using the following command (replace `<BEARER_TOKEN>` and `<SERVER_URL>` with your information):

```bash
$ ./rancher login https://<SERVER_URL> --token <BEARER_TOKEN>
```

If Rancher Server uses a self-signed certificate, Rancher CLI prompts you to continue with the connection.

## Project Selection

Before you can perform any commands, you must select a Rancher project to perform those commands against. To select a [project](../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/manage-clusters/projects-and-namespaces.md) to work on, use the command `./rancher context switch`. When you enter this command, a list of available projects displays. Enter a number to choose your project.

**Example: `./rancher context switch` Output**
```
User:rancher-cli-directory user$ ./rancher context switch
NUMBER    CLUSTER NAME   PROJECT ID              PROJECT NAME
1         cluster-2      c-7q96s:p-h4tmb         project-2
2         cluster-2      c-7q96s:project-j6z6d   Default
3         cluster-1      c-lchzv:p-xbpdt         project-1
4         cluster-1      c-lchzv:project-s2mch   Default
Select a Project:
```

After you enter a number, the console displays a message that you've changed projects.

```
INFO[0005] Setting new context to project project-1
INFO[0005] Saving config to /Users/markbishop/.ranchcli2.json
```

Ensure you can run `rancher kubectl get pods` successfully.

Once logged into Rancher Server using the CLI, enter `./rancher --help` for a list of commands.

All commands accept the `--help` flag, which documents each command's usage.

## Limitations

The Rancher CLI **cannot** be used to install [dashboard apps or Rancher feature charts](../../how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/helm-charts-in-rancher.md).
