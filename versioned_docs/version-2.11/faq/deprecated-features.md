## What is Rancher's deprecation policy?

The community version of Rancher follows the same deprecation policy as Rancher Prime. The official deprecation policy is documented in the [Rancher Prime Deprecation Policy](https://www.suse.com/support/rancher-prime/#Rancher-Prime-Deprecation-Policy).

## What can I expect when a feature is marked for deprecation?

In the release where functionality is marked as "Deprecated", it will still be available and supported allowing upgrades to follow the usual procedure. Once upgraded, users/admins should start planning to move away from the deprecated functionality before upgrading to the release it marked as removed. The recommendation for new deployments is to not use the deprecated feature.
