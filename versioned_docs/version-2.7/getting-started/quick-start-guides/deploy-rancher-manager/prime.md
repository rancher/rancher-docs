SUSE Rancher introduces Rancher Prime – an evolution of Rancher – from version v2.7. Rancher Prime is the new commercially available enterprise offering of Rancher, built on the same open source code. The Rancher project will continue to be 100% open source. Prime introduces additional value with greater security assurances, extended lifecycles, access to focused architectures and Kubernetes advisories. Rancher Prime will also offer options to get production support for innovative Rancher projects. With Rancher Prime, installation assets are hosted on a trusted registry owned and managed by Rancher.
