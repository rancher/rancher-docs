title: v2.7
description: Dummy file used to redirect to the base url
---

<!-- Redirect plugin currently does not allow the final segment of a url (e.g. /v2.7/faq is valid, but /v2.7 is not)
     to contain a period so this method is used to to allow users to access baseurl/v2.7 and be redirected to baseurl

     releaseTask: when a new minor version is released, the name of this file and the title need to be updated.
