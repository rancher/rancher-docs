title: Azure Marketplace Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) Integration
---

## Overview

Rancher Prime integrates with the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com) as a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) offering. This brings the value of running and managing Kubernetes environments to Azure customers, benefiting from a new pay-monthly pricing model available through the Azure Marketplace. This listing will enable you to manage any CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution in Azure, on-prem, or at the edge. To learn more, see our non-EMEMA and EMEA Azure Marketplace offerings for Rancher Prime:
