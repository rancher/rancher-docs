# Edit The Docs

To get started, fork and clone the rancher-docs repository.

Our repository doesn't allow you to make changes directly to the `main` branch. Create a working branch and make pull requests from your fork to [rancher/rancher-docs](https://github.com/rancher/rancher-docs). 

## Style & Formatting

The docs are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). We refer to the Microsoft [style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) and generally use standard American English. Many pages are also available in Simplified Chinese.

Every docs page contain metadata in the first few lines:

```
---
title: Some Title
---
```

The `title` is rendered as the page's headline. The site renderer wraps the `title` value in `H1` tags, which are equivalent to `#` in Markdown syntax. This means that all subsequent headers on the page should be second level (`##`) or more.

## Docs Website

The Rancher Docs website is built with [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

You can run the site on your local machine, to preview how pages on your working branch will look live.

First, install Docusaurus 2:

1. If you haven't already, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
1. Go into your local rancher-docs folder.
1. The Rancher Docs repository already contains a yarn.lock file, which contains the dependencies you need to build the website. Run `yarn` to install Docusaurus and associated dependencies.

### Start Site

```
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server for Docusaurus 2, and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

**Note:** The `yarn start` command won't include some important static site features. For example, switching between languages from the site's dropdown menu is not available. If you need these features, use `yarn build`.

### Build Site

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Launch With Docker

You can also use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to launch the website.

The below command can be used to install the dependencies and run the site inside a container:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD -p 3000:3000 node:18 /bin/sh -c "yarn install && yarn start -h 0.0.0.0"
```

Subsequent executions will check for updated dependencies, if there are none, it will skip the updates and quickly start the server.
