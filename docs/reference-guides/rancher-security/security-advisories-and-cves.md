Rancher is committed to informing the community of security issues in our products. Rancher will publish security advisories and CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) for issues we have resolved. New security advisories are also published in Rancher's GitHub [security page](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories).

| ID | Description | Date | Resolution |
|----|-------------|------|------------|
| [CVE-2024-58260](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-q82v-h4rq-5c86) | Setting the username of one user as the same username of another user causes an error when either user attempts to log in. Therefore, a user with the `Manage Users` permission could potentially deny any user, including admins, from logging in. To prevent this, usernames have been made immutable once set, and it is not possible to update or create a user with a username that is already in use. | 25 Sep 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.2), [v2.11.6](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.6), [v2.10.10](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.10), and [v2.9.12](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.12) |
| [CVE-2024-58267](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-v3vj-5868-2ch2) | The Rancher CLI is modified to print the `requestId` more visibly than as part of the login URL. It also adds a `cli=true` origin marker to the URL. The dashboard is modified to recognize the presence of the `requestId` and uses that to show a warning message to the user, asking for verification that they initiated a CLI login with the related Id. The non-presence of the origin marker enables the dashboard to distinguish between the modified CLI and older CLIâ€™s, and adjust the message accordingly. | 25 Sep 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.2), [v2.11.6](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.6), [v2.10.10](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.10), and [v2.9.12](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.12) |
| [CVE-2025-54468](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-mjcp-rj3c-36fr) | `Impersonate-*` headers are removed for requests made through the `/meta/proxy` Rancher endpoint (e.g. when cloud credentials are being created) as the headers may contain identifiable and/or sensitive information. | 25 Sep 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.2](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.2), [v2.11.6](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.6), [v2.10.10](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.10), and [v2.9.12](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.12) |
| [CVE-2024-58259](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-4h45-jpvh-6p5j) | POSTs to the Rancher API endpoints are now limited to 1 Mi; this is configurable through the settings if you need a larger limit. The Rancher authentication endpoints are configured independently of the main public API (as you might need bigger payloads in the other API endpoints). Suppose you need to increase the maximum allowed payload for authentication. In that case, you can set the environment variable `CATTLE_AUTH_API_BODY_LIMIT` to a quantity, e.g., 2 Mi, which would allow larger payloads for the authentication endpoints. | 28 Aug 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.1), [v2.11.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.5), [v2.10.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.9) and [v2.9.11](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.9.11) |
| [CVE-2024-52284](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-6h9x-9j5v-7w9h) | Following a recent [change](https://github.com/rancher/fleet/pull/3403) excluding Helm values files from bundles, an edge case subsisted where the values files referenced in `fleet.yaml` with your directory name (e.g., `my-dir/values.yaml` instead of `values.yaml`) would not be excluded, which would potentially expose confidential data in bundle resources. Helm values files are now excluded from bundle resources regardless of how you reference them. | 28 Aug 2025 | Rancher [v2.12.1](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.12.1), [v2.11.5](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.11.5) and [v2.10.9](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/releases/tag/v2.10.9) |
