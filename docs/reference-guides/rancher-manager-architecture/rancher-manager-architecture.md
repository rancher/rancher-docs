For a list of main features of the Rancher API server, refer to the [overview section.](../../getting-started/overview.md#features-of-the-rancher-api-server)

For guidance about setting up the underlying infrastructure for the Rancher server, refer to the [architecture recommendations.](architecture-recommendations.md)
