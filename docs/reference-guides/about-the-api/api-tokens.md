By default, some cluster-level API tokens are generated with infinite time-to-live (`ttl=0`). In other words, API tokens with `ttl=0` never expire unless you invalidate them. Tokens are not invalidated by changing a password.

You can deactivate API tokens by deleting them or by deactivating the user account.

### Deleting tokens
To delete a token,

1. Go to the list of all tokens in the Rancher API view at `https://<Rancher-Server-IP>/v3/tokens`.

1. Access the token you want to delete by its ID. For example, `https://<Rancher-Server-IP>/v3/tokens/kubectl-shell-user-vqkqt`

1. Click **Delete**.

Here is the complete list of tokens that are generated with `ttl=0`:

| Token             | Description                                                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubeconfig-*`    | Kubeconfig token                                                                       |
| `kubectl-shell-*` | Access to `kubectl` shell in the browser                                               |
| `agent-*`         | Token for agent deployment                                                             |
| `compose-token-*` | Token for compose                                                                      |
| `helm-token-*`    | Token for Helm chart deployment                                                        |
| `telemetry-*`     | Telemetry token                                                                        |
| `drain-node-*`    | Token for drain (we use `kubectl` for drain because there is no native Kubernetes API) |


### Setting TTL on Kubeconfig Tokens

Admins can set a global time-to-live (TTL) on Kubeconfig tokens. Changing the default kubeconfig TTL can be done by navigating to global settings and setting [`kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`](#kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes) to the desired duration in minutes. The default value of [`kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes`](#kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes) is 0, which means tokens never expire.

:::note

This setting is used by all kubeconfig tokens except those created by the CLI to [generate kubeconfig tokens](#disable-tokens-in-generated-kubeconfigs).

:::

### Disable Tokens in Generated Kubeconfigs

1. Set the `kubeconfig-generate-token` setting to `false`. This setting instructs Rancher to no longer automatically generate a token when a user clicks on download a kubeconfig file. Once this setting is deactivated, a generated kubeconfig will reference the [Rancher CLI](../cli-with-rancher/kubectl-utility.md#authentication-with-kubectl-and-kubeconfig-tokens-with-ttl) to retrieve a short-lived token for the cluster. When this kubeconfig is used in a client, such as `kubectl`, the Rancher CLI needs to be installed to complete the log in request.

2. Set the `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` setting to the desired duration in minutes. By default, `kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes` is 960 (16 hours).

### Token Hashing

Users can enable token hashing, where tokens will undergo a one-way hash using the SHA256 algorithm. This is a non-reversible process, once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled. It is advisable to take backups prior to enabling and/or evaluating in a test environment first.

To enable token hashing, refer to [this section](../../pages-for-subheaders/enable-experimental-features.md).

This feature will affect all tokens which include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Kubeconfig tokens
- Bearer tokens API keys/calls
- Tokens used by internal operations

### Token Settings
These global settings affect Rancher token behavior.

#### auth-user-session-ttl-minutes
Time to live (TTL) duration in minutes used to determine when a user auth session token expires. When expired, the user will be required to log in and obtain a new token. This setting is not affected by [`auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`](#auth-token-max-ttl-minutes). Session tokens are created when a user logs into Rancher.

#### kubeconfig-default-token-TTL-minutes
Time to live (TTL) duration in minutes used to determine when a kubeconfig token expires. When the token is expired, the API will reject the token. This setting can not be larger than [`auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`](#auth-token-max-ttl-minutes). This setting applies to a token generated in a requested kubeconfig file. Except those [generated by Rancher CLI](#disable-tokens-in-generated-kubeconfigs).
**Introduced in version 2.6.6**.

#### kubeconfig-token-ttl-minutes
Time to live (TTL) duration in minutes used to determine when a kubeconfig token that was generated by the CLI expires. Tokens are generated by the CLI when [`kubeconfig-generate-token`](#kubeconfig-generate-token) is false. When the token is expired, the API will reject the token. This setting can not be larger than [`auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`](#auth-token-max-ttl-minutes).
**Deprecated since version 2.6.6, and will be removed in 2.8.0: This setting will be replaced with the value of [`kubeconfig-default-token-TTL-minutes`](#kubeconfig-default-token-ttl-minutes).**

#### auth-token-max-ttl-minutes
Maximum Time to Live (TTL) in minutes allowed for auth tokens. If a user attempts to create a token with a TTL greater than `auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`, Rancher will set the token TTL to the value of `auth-token-max-ttl-minutes`. Auth tokens are tokens created for authenticating API requests.
**Changed in version 2.6.6: Applies to all kubeconfig tokens and api tokens.**

#### kubeconfig-generate-token
When true, kubeconfigs requested through the UI will contain a valid token. When false, the kubeconfig will contain a command that uses the Rancher CLI to prompt the user to log in. [The CLI then will retrieve and cache a token for the user](../cli-with-rancher/kubectl-utility.md#authentication-with-kubectl-and-kubeconfig-tokens-with-ttl).
