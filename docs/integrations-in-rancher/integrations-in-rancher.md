Prime is the Rancher ecosystem’s enterprise offering, with additional security, extended lifecycles, and access to Prime-exclusive documentation. Rancher Prime installation assets are hosted on a trusted SUSE registry, owned and managed by Rancher. The trusted Prime registry includes only stable releases that have been community-tested. 

Prime also offers options for production support, as well as add-ons to your subscription that tailor to your commercial needs.
