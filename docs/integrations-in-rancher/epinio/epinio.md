Epinio is a Kubernetes-based Application Development Platform. It helps operators and developers collaborate without conflict, and accelerates the development process. With Epinio, teams can move from application sources to a live URL in a single step.

## Epinio with Rancher  

Epinio's integration with Rancher gives developers a jump start, without having to deal with the installation process or configuration. You can install Epinio directly from the Rancher UI's Apps page.

## Epinio with Rancher Prime 

Rancher Prime customers can expect better integration of Epinio with other areas in the Rancher ecosystem such as:

- Better integration with Rancher authentication.  
- Integration with Neuvector and Kubewarden.
- Custom Helm chart templates with preset annotations to seamlessly integrate with monitoring and other key tools.
- Improved service marketplace.
